### 129. Which roles in an organization can view and manage security alerts for private repositories?

**More info**: [Roles in an organization](https://docs.github.com/ja/organizations/managing-peoples-access-to-your-organization-with-roles/roles-in-an-organization)

- [ ] Outside collaborators  
       Outside collaborators have repository-specific permissions only and are not organization members with security privileges.
- [ ] Repository maintainers  
       Maintainers can manage certain repository settings but do not have default access to organization-wide security alerts.
- [x] Organization owners and Security managers  
       **Correct**. Organization owners and Security managers can view and manage security alerts, including for private repositories.
- [ ] Billing managers

### 130. Which of these statements accurately describes a difference between personal accounts and organization accounts on GitHub?

**More info**: [Types of GitHub accounts](https://docs.github.com/ja/get-started/learning-about-github/types-of-github-accounts)

- [x] An organization account can have multiple owners and members, whereas a personal account belongs to a single user only.  
       **Correct**. Organizations allow for collaborative management by multiple people, while a personal account is tied to an individual.
- [ ] A personal account allows unlimited private repositories, but an organization account only allows public repositories.
- [ ] A personal account can only be accessed via SSH keys, while an organization account can only be accessed via passwords.
- [ ] An organization account can only be created if you have a GitHub Enterprise plan.  
       Organizations are available on Free, Team, or Enterprise plans.

### 131. Which statement best describes the difference between cloning a repository and forking a repository?

**More info**: [About forks](https://docs.github.com/ja/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/about-forks)

- [ ] When you clone a repository, changes you push go directly to the original repository. Forking requires a separate local copy.  
       Cloning and forking both result in separate local copies, but pushing to a clone requires the correct permission on the original repo.
- [x] Forking creates a copy under your GitHub account, while cloning creates a local copy on your computer without linking ownership to your account.  
       **Correct**. A fork is a GitHub-level copy that appears in your account, whereas a clone is a local-only copy.
- [ ] Cloning always transfers repository ownership, while forking does not.
- [ ] Only private repositories can be forked, whereas only public repositories can be cloned.

### 132. Which of these statements about pinned items on your GitHub profile is true?

**More info**: [Pinning items to your profile](https://docs.github.com/ja/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-profile/customizing-your-profile/pinning-items-to-your-profile)

- [ ] You can pin up to 10 repositories on your profile.
- [x] You can pin up to six repositories or gists on your profile for quick access.  
       **Correct**. GitHub supports pinning up to six items (repositories or gists).
- [ ] You can only pin public repositories, not private ones.
- [ ] Pinning an item deletes it from your repository list.

### 133. Which advanced search operator combination would you use to find public repositories with more than 100 stars that mention 'docker' in their name?

**More info**: [Searching repositories](https://docs.github.com/ja/search-github/searching-on-github/searching-for-repositories)

- [x] `in:name docker stars:>100 is:public`  
       **Correct**. This will find all public repositories that have 'docker' in their name and more than 100 stars.
- [ ] `docker in:description stars:<100 is:public`
- [ ] `is:public name:docker stars:100`  
       This is missing the range operator (`>`) for stars, and `name:docker` is not a valid syntax.
- [ ] `topic:docker stars:>100 in:readme`  
       This searches within topics or readmes, not the repository name.

### 134. Which of the following best describes GitHub secret scanning?

**More info**: [About secret scanning](https://docs.github.com/ja/code-security/secret-scanning/about-secret-scanning)

- [ ] A feature that scans issues for unverified credentials and deletes them automatically.  
       Secret scanning doesn't automatically delete anything; it detects potentially leaked secrets.
- [ ] A feature that encrypts your repository secrets before pushing them to GitHub.  
       GitHub Actions Encrypted Secrets handle encryption, but that’s different from secret scanning.
- [ ] A feature that runs third-party password managers on your code to store secrets securely.
- [x] A feature that searches repositories for known secret formats to prevent accidental exposure of sensitive data.  
       **Correct**. Secret scanning detects tokens, keys, and other credentials to help avoid leaks.

**More info**: [About GitHub Pages](https://docs.github.com/ja/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/about-github-pages)

       GitHub Pages sites are always publicly accessible, unless you use a project site with enterprise firewall rules on GitHub Enterprise Server.
- [x] GitHub Pages enables you to host static sites from a GitHub repository.  
       **Correct**. GitHub Pages is specifically for static site hosting from your repo.
- [ ] GitHub Pages automatically converts Java files into dynamic web apps.
- [ ] GitHub Pages can only be used by organization accounts.  
       Both personal and organization accounts can use Pages.
